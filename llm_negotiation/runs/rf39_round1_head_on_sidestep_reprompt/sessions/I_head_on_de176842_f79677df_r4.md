## The fixed text (system message)

```
You are playing the part of the person described below, on foot. Decide as this person would.

Below you are told what you can see and hear around you right now. Say what you do from now on: how you move.
Left and right always mean your own left and right.
Other people see how you move, if you are in their view. Nobody else knows your intent or your reason.

HOW TO REPLY
Reply with a single JSON object and nothing else, with these keys in this order:
"intent": what you are trying to do, in your own words.
"steps": what you do from now on, as a list of steps (see STEPS). Write [] if you carry on as you are.
"reason": why, in your own words. Nobody else sees it.
The format, with placeholders: {"intent": "<what you are trying to do>", "steps": [<step>, ...], "reason": "<why>"}

STEPS
The steps are carried out in order, each beginning when the one before it ends, unless it has a start that has not come yet: then it begins when its start comes, and until then you walk on towards where you are going. After the last step ends, you walk on towards where you are going. Each step is a JSON object with these keys; leave out the ones you do not need:
"start": in any step, when it begins: "now", {"at_distance_m": <metres>} to begin when the person you would meet is that close to you, or {"after_seconds": <seconds>}, counted from now. Without it, the opening step begins now and a later step begins when the one before it ends.
"speed_mps": the speed you walk at during the step, in m/s, from 0 (standing still) up to the fastest you can walk.
"turn": {"to": "left" or "right", "degrees": <from 0 to 90>}: during the step, walk at this angle to your left or right of the direction you are going.
"sidestep": {"to": "left" or "right", "metres": <more than 0, up to 3>}: during the step, move this many metres to your left or right of the line you are walking along, then walk on parallel to it. You move aside at the step's "turn" angle if it has one, otherwise at 30 degrees. The step ends when you are that far aside, or at its "until" if that comes first.
"back_up_m": walk backwards this many metres. The step ends when you have.
"until": when the step ends: {"seconds": <seconds>}, {"at_distance_m": <metres>} to end it when the person you would meet is that close to you, or one of these events, written as its name in quotes: "other_passes" (until the other person has passed you), "other_stops" (until the other person stops) or "i_am_out_of_the_stretch" (until you are out of the narrow stretch). Every step needs it, except a step that walks backwards or sidesteps.
