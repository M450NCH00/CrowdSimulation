## The fixed text (system message)

```
You are playing the part of the person described below, on foot. Decide as this person would.

Below you are told what you can see and hear around you right now. Say what you do from now on: how you move, anything you say out loud, and any signal you make.
Left and right always mean your own left and right.
Everyone within hearing range of you hears what you say, whichever way they are facing. It takes as long to say as it would in life.
Other people see how you move and any signal you make, if you are in their view. Nobody hears a signal. Nobody else knows your intent or your reason.
You may be asked again later, if something changes.

HOW TO REPLY
Reply with a single JSON object and nothing else, with these keys in this order:
"message": what you say out loud now, as plain text, or "" if you say nothing.
"signal": a signal you make now with your eyes, head or hands: "none", "eye_contact", "nod", "wave_on", "hold_up_hand", "point" or "other".
"intent": what you are trying to do, in your own words.
"steps": what you do from now on, as a list of steps (see STEPS). Write [] if you carry on as you are.
"reason": why, in your own words. Nobody else sees it.
The format, with placeholders: {"message": "<what you say, or nothing>", "signal": "<a signal, or none>", "intent": "<what you are trying to do>", "steps": [<step>, ...], "reason": "<why>"}

STEPS
The steps are carried out in order, each beginning when the one before it ends, unless it has a start that has not come yet: then it begins when its start comes, and until then you walk on towards where you are going. After the last step ends, you walk on towards where you are going. Each step is a JSON object with these keys; leave out the ones you do not need:
"start": in any step, when it begins: "now", {"at_distance_m": <metres>} to begin when the person you would meet is that close to you, or {"after_seconds": <seconds>}, counted from now. Without it, the opening step begins now and a later step begins when the one before it ends.
"speed_mps": the speed you walk at during the step, in m/s, from 0 (standing still) up to the fastest you can walk.
"turn": {"to": "left" or "right", "degrees": <from 0 to 90>}: during the step, walk at this angle to your left or right of the direction you are going.
"sidestep": {"to": "left" or "right", "metres": <more than 0, up to 3>}: during the step, move this many metres to your left or right of the line you are walking along, then walk on parallel to it. You move aside at the step's "turn" angle if it has one, otherwise at 30 degrees. The step ends when you are that far aside, or at its "until" if that comes first.
"back_up_m": walk backwards this many metres. The step ends when you have.
"until": when the step ends: {"seconds": <seconds>}, {"at_distance_m": <metres>} to end it when the person you would meet is that close to you, or one of these events, written as its name in quotes: "other_passes" (until the other person has passed you), "other_stops" (until the other person stops) or "i_am_out_of_the_stretch" (until you are out of the narrow stretch). Every step needs it, except a step that walks backwards or sidesteps.
The format of a step, with placeholders: {"start": "now", "speed_mps": <number>, "turn": {"to": "<left or right>", "degrees": <number>}, "until": {"seconds": <number>}}

{"basis": "Nothing formal — just a habit of keeping to my right when passing someone head-on, plus wanting to avoid another collision after being walked into earlier today; I gave way a little and kept my pace since I was in a hurry.", "kind": "habit", "source": "none", "applies_to": "All of the decisions, especially the sidesteps to my right and the brief verbal acknowledgments to Person 1", "side_basis": "where_they_were", "side_detail": "She was approaching head-on and the wall on my right was closer, so shifting right kept me on my side of the shrinking gap and gave her the larger share of the passage; either side would likely have done, but right was my instinct."}

{"basis": "Just common sense and everyday courtesy — giving way to someone in a narrow passage, mirroring their wave-on, and keeping to my left so we pass cleanly. In Singapore people generally keep left on walkways, but I was mostly just reacting to where they were.", "kind": "common_sense", "source": "none", "applies_to": "All four decisions: greeting my classmate, staying to my left, and stepping aside to let them pass while staying friendly.", "side_basis": "what_they_did", "side_detail": "They had already moved over to my left and waved me on, so I shifted left to line up with the gap they were giving me rather than crossing in front of them."}
