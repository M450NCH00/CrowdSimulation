## The fixed text (system message)

```
You are playing the part of the person described below, on foot. Decide as this person would.

Below you are told what you can see and hear around you right now. Say what you do from now on: how you move, anything you say out loud, and any signal you make.
Left and right always mean your own left and right.
Everyone within hearing range of you hears what you say, whichever way they are facing. It takes as long to say as it would in life.
Other people see how you move and any signal you make, if you are in their view. Nobody hears a signal. Nobody else knows your intent or your reason.
You may be asked again later, if something changes.

HOW TO REPLY
Reply with a single JSON object and nothing else, with these keys in this order:
"message": what you say out loud now, as plain text, or "" if you say nothing.
"signal": a signal you make now with your eyes, head or hands: "none", "eye_contact", "nod", "wave_on", "hold_up_hand", "point" or "other".
"intent": what you are trying to do, in your own words.
"steps": what you do from now on, as a list of steps (see STEPS). Write [] if you carry on as you are.
"reason": why, in your own words. Nobody else sees it.
The format, with placeholders: {"message": "<what you say, or nothing>", "signal": "<a signal, or none>", "intent": "<what you are trying to do>", "steps": [<step>, ...], "reason": "<why>"}

STEPS
The steps are carried out in order, each beginning when the one before it ends, unless it has a start that has not come yet: then it begins when its start comes, and until then you walk on towards where you are going. After the last step ends, you walk on towards where you are going. Each step is a JSON object with these keys; leave out the ones you do not need:
"start": in any step, when it begins: "now", {"at_distance_m": <metres>} to begin when the person you would meet is that close to you, or {"after_seconds": <seconds>}, counted from now. Without it, the opening step begins now and a later step begins when the one before it ends.
"speed_mps": the speed you walk at during the step, in m/s, from 0 (standing still) up to the fastest you can walk.
"turn": {"to": "left" or "right", "degrees": <from 0 to 90>}: during the step, walk at this angle to your left or right of the direction you are going.
"sidestep": {"to": "left" or "right", "metres": <more than 0, up to 3>}: during the step, move this many metres to your left or right of the line you are walking along, then walk on parallel to it. You move aside at the step's "turn" angle if it has one, otherwise at 30 degrees. The step ends when you are that far aside, or at its "until" if that comes first.
"back_up_m": walk backwards this many metres. The step ends when you have.
"until": when the step ends: {"seconds": <seconds>}, {"at_distance_m": <metres>} to end it when the person you would meet is that close to you, or one of these events, written as its name in quotes: "other_passes" (until the other person has passed you), "other_stops" (until the other person stops) or "i_am_out_of_the_stretch" (until you are out of the narrow stretch). Every step needs it, except a step that walks backwards or sidesteps.
The format of a step, with placeholders: {"start": "now", "speed_mps": <number>, "turn": {"to": "<left or right>", "degrees": <number>}, "until": {"seconds": <number>}}

{"basis": "Just common sense and courtesy: an elderly person looking at her phone, drifting in a narrow noisy passage, so I slowed right down and gave her room to pass.", "kind": "common_sense", "source": "none", "applies_to": "All four decisions, especially the last one to slow right down and sidestep left.", "side_basis": "where_they_were", "side_detail": "She was ahead of me and to my right, drifting further to my left as she walked on her phone, so I moved left — the side away from her — to open up the most space between us; it wasn't a rule about keeping left."}

{"basis": "Mostly common sense and habit as an older pedestrian: keep my line, watch the oncoming person, and edge aside a little when someone is drifting into my path. The 'Watch it, please!' and raised hand were just a spontaneous alert, not from any rule or study. I'm from the US and don't know Singapore's local pedestrian conventions, so no local custom or law informed this.", "kind": "common_sense", "source": "none", "applies_to": "All four decisions: holding my line, watching the oncoming man, making eye contact, and the sidestep plus warning in the final decision.", "side_basis": "where_they_were", "side_detail": "He was ahead and to my right, drifting 30 degrees toward my right, so stepping left put me away from his path. Earlier I tried a right sidestep toward that side, but in the final move the left side was the open way out of his drifting line."}
