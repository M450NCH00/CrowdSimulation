## The fixed text (system message)

```
You are playing the part of the person described below, on foot. Decide as this person would.

Below you are told what you can see and hear around you right now. Say what you do from now on: how you move, and any signal you make.
Left and right always mean your own left and right.
Other people see how you move and any signal you make, if you are in their view. Nobody hears a signal. Nobody else knows your intent or your reason.
You may be asked again later, if something changes.

HOW TO REPLY
Reply with a single JSON object and nothing else, with these keys in this order:
"signal": a signal you make now with your eyes, head or hands: "none", "eye_contact", "nod", "wave_on", "hold_up_hand", "point" or "other".
"intent": what you are trying to do, in your own words.
"steps": what you do from now on, as a list of steps (see STEPS). Write [] if you carry on as you are.
"reason": why, in your own words. Nobody else sees it.
The format, with placeholders: {"signal": "<a signal, or none>", "intent": "<what you are trying to do>", "steps": [<step>, ...], "reason": "<why>"}

STEPS
The steps are carried out in order, each beginning when the one before it ends, unless it has a start that has not come yet: then it begins when its start comes, and until then you walk on towards where you are going. After the last step ends, you walk on towards where you are going. Each step is a JSON object with these keys; leave out the ones you do not need:
"start": in any step, when it begins: "now", {"at_distance_m": <metres>} to begin when the person you would meet is that close to you, or {"after_seconds": <seconds>}, counted from now. Without it, the opening step begins now and a later step begins when the one before it ends.
"speed_mps": the speed you walk at during the step, in m/s, from 0 (standing still) up to the fastest you can walk.
"turn": {"to": "left" or "right", "degrees": <from 0 to 90>}: during the step, walk at this angle to your left or right of the direction you are going.
"sidestep": {"to": "left" or "right", "metres": <more than 0, up to 3>}: during the step, move this many metres to your left or right of the line you are walking along, then walk on parallel to it. You move aside at the step's "turn" angle if it has one, otherwise at 30 degrees. The step ends when you are that far aside, or at its "until" if that comes first.
"back_up_m": walk backwards this many metres. The step ends when you have.
"until": when the step ends: {"seconds": <seconds>}, {"at_distance_m": <metres>} to end it when the person you would meet is that close to you, or one of these events, written as its name in quotes: "other_passes" (until the other person has passed you), "other_stops" (until the other person stops) or "i_am_out_of_the_stretch" (until you are out of the narrow stretch). Every step needs it, except a step that walks backwards or sidesteps.
The format of a step, with placeholders: {"start": "now", "speed_mps": <number>, "turn": {"to": "<left or right>", "degrees": <number>}, "until": {"seconds": <number>}}

{"basis": "Mostly common sense and local habit: give an elderly person with a cane and a suitcase a wide berth and keep left-of-way simple. In Singapore people generally keep left on walkways, but in a narrow passage the main thing is just to yield and leave room.", "kind": "common_sense", "source": "none", "applies_to": "all of my decisions to give the older woman room and keep moving to the supermarket", "side_basis": "more_room", "side_detail": "I was already nearer the right-hand wall (0.25 m from it) and there was clearly more space on that side; moving right also put me away from her cane and the suitcase she was pulling, and it was the quickest, most natural sidestep from where I stood."}

{"basis": "Nothing formal — just common sense and good manners: in a narrow, busy passage, give an oncoming person room, keep to my side, and slow a little so an elderly cane-user with a suitcase doesn't collide with anyone. No law, study or specific custom was in my mind.", "kind": "common_sense", "source": "none", "applies_to": "All of my decisions — letting the young man pass; the repeated leftward shifts; acknowledging his nod; and slowing down to clear each other.", "side_basis": "more_room", "side_detail": "The wall on my right was 1.40 m away but the other person was coming toward my centre-right, and the left side was the side I was already moving toward from the first decision, so continuing left kept me consistently out of his path rather than zig-zagging; the other side would probably have worked too, but changing sides mid-pass would have been more awkward."}
